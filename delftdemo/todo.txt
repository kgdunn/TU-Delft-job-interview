CPUTracker::Gauss2DResult CPUTracker::Compute2DGaussianMLE(vector2f initial, int iterations, float sigma)


Add operator= function to the Image class

Template the Image class, to allow float and int
Make the subsmapling the happen in real

Function that callss Gauss and Threshold repeatedly


Use const where you can.

Time function: start to end. How to check that accurately?
